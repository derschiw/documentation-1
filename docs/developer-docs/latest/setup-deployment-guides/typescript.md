# TypeScript support

::: callout ðŸš§  TypeScript documentation
This section is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated and improved. In the meantime, feel free to ask for help on the [forum](https://forum.strapi.io/) or on the community [Discord](https://discord.strapi.io).
:::

TypeScript adds an additional type system layer above JavaScript, which means that existing JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. Strapi supports TypeScript in new and existing projects running v4.2.0 and above. The core Developer Documentation contains code snippets in both JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Create a new TypeScript project

Create a Strapi project with Typescript support by using the `--ts` or `--typescript` flags with either the npm or yarn package manager.

::: tip
Adding the `--quickstart` flag will create the project with an SQlite database.

<!-- UPDATE these code blocks for the stable release-->

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">

```sh
npx create-strapi-app@beta my-app --ts
#or
npx create-strapi-app@beta my-app --typescript
```

</code-block>

<!-- <code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn create-strapi-app@latest my-project --ts

# or

yarn create-strapi-app@latest my-project --typescript
```
</code-block> -->

</code-group>

## Understand TypeScript support

TypeScript-enabled Strapi applications have a directory `dist` at the project root and 2 `tsconfig.json` files (see [project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md)).

| TypeScript-Specific directories and files | Purpose                                                     | Location         |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `dist` directory                          |  Location for compiling the project JavaScript source code. | application root |
| `tsconfig.json` file                      | Manages TypeScript compilation for the server.              | application root |
| `tsconfig.json` file                      | Manages TypeScript compilation for the admin panel.         | `./src/admin/`   |

Starting the development environment for a TypeScript-enabled project requires building the admin panel prior to starting the server. In development mode, the application source code is compiled to the `./dist/build` directory and recompiled with each change in the Content-type Builder. To start the application run the following commands:

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">

```sh
npm run build
npm run develop
```

</code-block>

 <code-block title="YARN">

```sh
yarn build
yarn develop
```

</code-block>

</code-group>

## Use TypeScript typings

<!--Something here -->

## Develop a plugin using TypeScript

New plugins can be generated following the [plugins development documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins-development.md). There are 2 important distinctions for TypeScript applications:

1. After creating the plugin, run `yarn install` or `npm run install` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to install the dependencies for the plugin.
2. Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to build the admin panel including the plugin.

It is not necessary to repeat the `yarn install` or `npm run install` command after the initial installation. The `yarn build` or `npm run build` commands is necessary to implement any plugin development that affects the admin panel.

<!-- 

::: caution 
    The plugin name must be kebab-case.
    Example: an-example-of-kebab-case
    :::


- link to normal plugin dev information
- New: there is a typescript option in the "strapi generate plugin" that launches the interactive CLI
- use the yarn build && yarn develop to build the admin and compile the JS version to the dist folder. 
- >

<!--- a `tsconfig.json` file at the root of the project, to manage TypeScript compilation for the server,

- a `/src/admin/tsconfig.json` to manage TypeScript compilation for the admin panel. 

TypeScript-enabled projects also contain a `dist` directory, which is used to compile the project JavaScript source code. -->
